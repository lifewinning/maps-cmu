# Neat Mapping Tools For You To Know About
CMU Mapping Intensive, 1/17/15

***

## Companies Offering Services
A lot of the platforms and open source tools currently available for web mapping are products supported by companies. We're not going deep into the specifics of these platforms and tools mainly because (1) I didn't really want to waste time on people registering for accounts and API keys and (2) these companies are all really, really good at documentation of their products and I am pretty sure you're all perfectly competent people. 

In addition to information about their specific tools, I've included some background on the companies--software doesn't emerge from a vacuum.
