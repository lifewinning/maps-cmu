# Stuff I find really helpful for working with map data

***

**Note: this is not exhaustive, and will probably be updated more as needed**

- [ogr2ogr](www.gdal.org/ogr2ogr.html): part of GDAL, great for converting geodata into different formats
- [gpsbabel](http://gpsbabel.org): like ogr2ogr, useful for converting geodata into other formats; 
- [geojson.io](http://geojson.io): made by Tom MacWright of Mapbox, basically just a really useful tool for taking a quick glance at your data and seeing what's there before getting into design for your own map
- [togeojson](https://github.com/mapbox/togeojson): another useful Mapbox-built tool for converting geodata when ogr2ogr is too onerous
- [joiner](https://github.com/mhkeller/joiner): made by my friend Michael Keller; super useful for combinging existing geojson with other json data
- [geojson-merge](https://github.com/mapbox/geojson-merge): got a bunch of geojson files that you'd rather put into one file? PROBLEM SOLVED, MY FRIEND.
- [a pile of shell scripts by my friend Chris Henrick](https://github.com/clhenrick/shell_scripts): just a way of making GDAL stuff slightly less onerous.
