# A Non-Exhaustive And Likely To Be Updated List Of Places to Get and Look for Geodata
***

- [Natural Earth](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/): resource for world vector geodata (shapefiles) at 1:10m, 1:50m, and 1:110 million scales. 
- OpenStreetMap
	- wiki page on map features: [wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features)
	- [Overpass](http://overpass-turbo.eu) for extracting OSM data
- [GeoFabrik](http://download.geofabrik.de/): shapefiles of different pieces of OSM data carved into pieces
- [Metro Extracts](http://mapzen.com/metro-extracts): OSM data for metropolitan regional areas around the world, in a variety of formats
- [The US Census Bureau's TIGER shapefiles](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger.html): this is the data that the Census Bureau uses to make its maps. 
	- TIGER doesn't come with all that weird Census data that people cite in news stories. To make a map of data like that, you have to join TIGER data to [American Community Survey](factfinder.census.gov) data.
	- Given that government geodata websites are Almost Always The Worst, you might also enjoy [Census Reporter](http://censusreporter.org/).
	- Lots of other kinds of government data can be linked back to Census data, like data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Bureau of Justice Statistics. 
- [USGS EarthExplorer](http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov): Excellent resource for free, awesome satellite imagery. Kind of clunky interface options but um, hi I said *free awesome satellite imagery*, you'll deal.
- Municipal/state government data portals. For U.S. cities, try Googling the name of any city + "GIS"--for example, here's one for [Pittsburgh](http://pittsburghpa.gov/dcp/gis/gis-data)
- Related Google-fu, a lot of the time if I'm looking for data on a specific topic or subject or region, I try searching that term + "shapefile"--a lot of people doing spatial analysis are still in desktop-land, so a lot of stuff continues to be released as shapefiles.
- [OpenAddresses](https://openaddresses.io/) is a repository of address data. Mostly useful if you're compiling your own geocoder (why would you do that) or...IDK, if you like address data.
- [The Global Open Data Index](http://index.okfn.org/dataset/) (you'll be looking specifically at some of the map-related datasets)
